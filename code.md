# Code of Conduct for the Hack to End Homelessness

This hackathon is a community event intended for innovation, collaboration, and engagement in the community.

We value the participation of everyone present and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the event.

To make clear what is expected, all attendees, speakers, and volunteers at the event event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct.

## Be Respectful
Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and racist, sexist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for this event.

## Be Thoughtful
In the spirit of innovation and inclusiveness, there may be minors participating in the event. Keep this in mind when choosing a location to work, and mention to the organizers that your content is explicit if you’d like to submit for judging. You will be pitching to judges and other attendees after the non-explicit content. You will present your idea to an audience who is explicitly prepared to experience your presentation in a safe and/or designated area.

## Be Open 
We welcome attendees from all backgrounds and skill levels - from “never been to hackathon before” to experts. This event is about increasing the overall amount of innovation, partnership, and engagement in our community.

## Be Awesome
Do your best. Prepare something to show others.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the hackathon at the sole discretion of the hackathon organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.
